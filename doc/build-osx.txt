See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building russiacoin QT, the
graphical user interface.

Tested on 10.14.1 and 10.14.2 intel.  PPC is not supported because it's big-endian.

All of the commands should be executed in terminal.app.. it's in
/Applications/Utilities

You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler and
everything is available in /usr not just /Developer I think it comes on the DVD
but you can get the current version from https://developer.apple.com/


1.  Clone the github tree to get the source code:

git clone https://github.com/Laputaria/RC.git russiacoin

2.  Download and install MacPorts from https://www.macports.org/

2a. (for 10.15 Mohavy)
    Edit /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf and comments "build_arch i786"

3.  Install dependencies from MacPorts

macports install boost_1_69_0 db-18.1.25 openssl-1.0.2q miniupnpc-2.1

Optionally install qrencode (and set USE_QRCODE=1):
macports install qrencode-4.0.2

4.  Now you should be able to build russiacoind:

cd RC/src
make -f makefile.osx

Run:
  ./russiacoind --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./russiacoind -daemon # to start the russiacoin daemon.
Run
  ./russiacoind help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands
