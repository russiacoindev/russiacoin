Intro
-----
russiacoin is a free open source project derived from NovaCoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin and NovaCoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.

Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/russiacoind (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/russiacoind (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 12788 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  russiacoin works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the russiacoin network.

Then shutdown russiacoind by
russiacoind stop
Start up the new russiacoind.
